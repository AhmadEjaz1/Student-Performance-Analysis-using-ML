# Student-Performance-Analysis-using-ML
This project aims to predict whether a student has completed a test preparation course based on their academic performance (math, reading, writing scores) and demographic background (parental education level, gender). The goal is to identify key factors influencing course completion and build a model that can generalize well to new data.
